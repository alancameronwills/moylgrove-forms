/// Shortcode for showing form
///
/// Use this shortcode to do your own shape of form
/// (Or use the easier standard form shortcode, which uses this one)
///
/// See the description on the admin page
///
/// Shortcode attributes:
///   full - Set this only when you're sold out. A message such as "Sorry, we're sold out!"
/// - prices - Required if you want to charge via PayPal or card as part of the booking process
///			List of pairs of <field-name price> all space-separated.
///			Field-name is a numeric field used in your form. Prices in Â£, e.g. 10 or 5.67
///			The price charged will be sum of field_value * price
///   seats - e.g. "adults kids meals". Numeric fields you want counted up in the table of bookings.
///			If the customer sets all of these to 0, booking is regarded as cancelled.
/// - name - the WP slug of the page to get title etc from. Default = the containing page
/// - id - the ID of the booking.
///			Default = URL parameter 'id' || cookie for the current user = the booking they made on the previous visit.
/// - bcc - Comma-separated emails to send a notification of each booking to.
/// - submit - Text of the Submit button. Default "Book and pay"
///
/// Body content:
/// Within the body of the shortcode, provide two parts separated by a line of "====".
/// The first part is the HTML template of the web page form; the second is the plain text acknowledgement email
/// In the HTML form body, you can use all the usual HTML and a <style> section.
/// Other shortcodes within the body will typically work.
/// Within the form, you can use:
///		{fieldName x 1 10} - Defines a field that will be stored in the database, generally input by the user
///			x = numeric | text | email | calculated | submit
///			If you don't include your own submit button, we'll provide one
///			calculated = readonly. Used for fields with specific reserved names
/// 		1 10 = range for numeric fields; or first number is size in characters for text fields
///		{paid c 6} The amount received from the user for this booking.
/// 	{totalPrice c 6} The sum of the priced items
///		{calculation c 30} The computation of the totalPrice
///		{amountDue} How much the user owes us = totalPrice - paid.
///		{state}Book your seats || You've booked! || You've cancelled || Please pay{/state}
///			- message depending on state of booking
///		{paid gt totalPrice}We owe you{/gt} - conditional message. You can use a number as the second field
///		{paypal} - Put the PayPal buttons here
